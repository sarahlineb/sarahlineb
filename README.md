### 🌱 Hi there 🍃  🌞 Welcome to Sarah's Github 🌞

👾 I am currently working on building a service called Underground, a music streaming service that provides a user with lesser-known artists based off their personal listening preferences ✨🎧 I'm using Java and HTML with IntelliJ, and DynamoDB to create the most efficient experience for the user 💪🏼

🚐 I am also currently building a custom sprinter van for my life on the road! 🏕 🏔 🗾 🛣 
Everything from the engine, to the floorboards, to the perfect custom desk set-up and all the electric wiring is built and maintained by me! I guess you could say I just love building things 🛠⚙️🔧
